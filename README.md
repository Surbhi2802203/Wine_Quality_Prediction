Wine Quality Prediction

Project Overview

This project aims to predict the quality of wine based on its chemical characteristics, providing a practical application of machine learning techniques in the field of viticulture. The dataset includes various chemical attributes, such as density, acidity, and more, which are used to train and evaluate different classifier models. The goal is to identify which model best predicts wine quality.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project, WineQT.csv, consists of multiple features related to the chemical properties of wine, including:

a. Fixed Acidity

b. Volatile Acidity

c. Citric Acid

d. Residual Sugar

e. Chlorides

f. Free Sulfur Dioxide

g. Total Sulfur Dioxide

h. Density

i. pH

j. Sulphates

k. Alcohol

l. Quality

Each row represents a wine sample, and the quality is the target variable to be predicted.

Key Concepts and Challenges

Classifier Models

Three distinct classifier models are utilized for predicting wine quality:

Random Forest Classifier: A versatile and robust ensemble learning method.

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Classifier: A simple yet efficient approach suitable for large datasets.

Support Vector Classifier (SVC): A powerful model for classification tasks, effective in high-dimensional spaces.

Chemical Qualities

The project focuses on analyzing key chemical attributes, such as:

a. Density

b. Acidity

c. Residual Sugar

d. Sulphates

These features play a crucial role in determining the quality of wine and serve as the predictors in our models.

Data Analysis Libraries

Several data analysis libraries are employed for efficient data manipulation and array operations, including:

Pandas: For loading, cleaning, and manipulating the dataset.

Numpy: For performing numerical operations and handling arrays.

Data Visualization

Data visualization tools are used to gain insights into the dataset and understand the patterns in wine quality:

Seaborn: For creating attractive and informative statistical graphics.

Matplotlib: For generating a wide range of plots and charts.

Methodology
